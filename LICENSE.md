## Relationship to standard licenses

This agreement is **not** equivalent to MIT, BSD, Apache, GPL, or any other OSI-approved license because those licenses allow redistribution and commercial reuse. It is also narrower than noncommercial templates such as the PolyForm Noncommercial License, which still permit certain sharing without explicit approval. The bespoke Autod Personal Use License is therefore required to enforce the owner’s “no redistribution without written consent” policy.
